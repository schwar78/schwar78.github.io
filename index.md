## About Me
I am a recent college graduate as of December 2024 with a degree in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics from Wheaton College IL. I am both a team player a confident leader, adaptable, and eager to apply my skills to new challenges. Aside from my programming, I am also passionate about education, and problem-solving. 

Moving forward I am hoping to explore opportunities in software development, IT consulting, or product or project management. I enjoy problem-solving and want to work in a collaborative environment working to find better solutions. I want to work with tech and be a mediator between engineers and other team members. I believe that a lot of problems can be avoided through clear communication and I hope to bring that to whatever team I am a apart of.
