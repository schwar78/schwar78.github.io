## About Me
I'm a recent Computer Science graduate with a minor in Mathematics from Wheaton College, IL. Throughout my academic journey, I've developed a strong foundation in programming, problem-solving, and collaborative teamwork. I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve complex problems and continuously seek opportunities to grow my skills and contribute to impactful projects. I am particularly excited to explore opportunities in software development, IT consulting, and product or project management, where I can serve as a mediator between technical teams and stakeholders or customers to deliver better solutions

In addition to my technical abilities, I am deeply passionate about education and sharing knowledge, helping others to grow and understand complex concepts. My goal is to work in a dynamic and collaborative environment where I can continue learning and contribute to creating efficient, scalable solutions.
